# Vacation Destinations Based on Global Weather Analysis

Included in this repository are two .ipynb files. Run the weatherPy file and upon completion you can run the vacationPy file. The weatherPy file generates a random list of cities and gathers their weather data to show an analysis of current weather in each city as it relates to it's closeness to the equator.

The vcationPy file uses the list of cities and weather data generated by weatherPy to determine which cities meet a certain criteria. It then shows a map of the humidity from all the original cities and then a map with the nearest hotels pinned to the map where these ideal vacation cities are located.

Also included in this repository are screenshots of the aforementioned maps with data generated on 2/4/2021 as well as .png files for all of the scatter plots generated in weatherPy comparing the latitude to disfferent weather metrics.
